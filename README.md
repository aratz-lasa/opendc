# Evaluation of Datacenter Scheduler Programming Abstractions

This repository contains the evaluation code and experiments written in Kotlin for the research work titled "The Cost of Simplicity: Understanding Datacenter Scheduler Programming Abstractions" presented at the Middleware 2023 conference. The work investigates the performance impact of various datacenter scheduler programming abstractions.

## Getting Started

The code for all the specific experiments can be found in the opendc-experiments/scheduling-apis directory of the repository. To run the experiments, make sure to place the relevant traces in the corresponding experiment folder within this directory. For example, an example trace bitbrains-small is provided in the traces directory for your reference.

### Prerequisites
- Kotlin and Gradle should be installed on your machine.

### Setup Traces
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `opendc-experiments/scheduling-apis` folder.
3. Place the relevant traces for the experiment you want to run in the corresponding experiment folder.

### Compile and Run
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the `opendc` project directory.
2. Run the command `./gradlew :opendc-experiments:<experiment>:experiment` to compile and run the desired experiment.

## OpenDC
The evaluation experiments are performed using OpenDC, an open-source data center simulation platform. OpenDC allows for accurate and realistic simulations of data center environments, enabling thorough evaluation and analysis of various scheduling APIs and their impact on performance.

OpenDC is a free and open-source platform for datacenter simulation aimed at both research and education.

![Datacenter construction in OpenDC](docs/images/screenshot-construction.png)

Users can construct datacenters (see above) and define portfolios of scenarios (experiments) to see how these
datacenters perform under different workloads and schedulers (see below).

The simulator is accessible both as a ready-to-use website hosted by us at [opendc.org](https://opendc.org), and as
source code that users can run locally on their own machine, through Docker.
